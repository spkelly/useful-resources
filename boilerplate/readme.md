# Boilerplate


 A bunch of stuff that I have written over and over and don't want to have to re write

 - [HTML Starter](./standard_html)
    - a standard html document with bootstrap, jquery and css files included and linked
- [React Simple Starter](https://github.com/stephengrider/reduxsimplestarter)
    - Stephen Grider's react starter boilerplate from his udemy courses
